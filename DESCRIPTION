Description: R package spsRdata is complementary to the R package spsR. The purpose of spsRdata is to facilitate data collection for multi-country studies. Users can supply data they prepared on using spsRdata to sps() for site selection. Users can start with the default data set sps_country_data that contains a wide range of commonly-used country-level variables in the social sciences. spsRdata also offers several functions to merge additional country-level variables from well-known data sets (e.g., V-Dem and World Bank) as well as from any external data users want to add. While R package spsRdata currently only focuses on country-level data collection, we emphasize that R package sps and the corresponding SPS algorithm can be applied to any type of study site (e.g., states, districts, villages, or schools).
